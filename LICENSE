### ✅ What you should do:
1. Save the above content to your existing `README.md`.
2. Create a `requirements.txt` listing the used libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `imbalanced-learn`).
3. Add or update the `LICENSE` file (if not already present).

Let me know if you’d like help generating the `requirements.txt`, adding badges, or polishing any section further!
